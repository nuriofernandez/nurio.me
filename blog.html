                For many people, Minecraft is just a game about cubes. And that's absolutely
                right. Minecraft embraces simplicity, embraces to create stuff with very little.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Everything, from the game mechanics, to the graphics, is made simple.

                You probably read about the famous "less is more", and Minecraft Redstone makes it shine.
                It is a material in the game, able to be used as cables, switches, etc.
                In other words, it allows players to build circuits. It could sound complicated but
                it's not complicated at all.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                The capabilities of Redstone are also very simple, move one block, open a door, add delay, etc.
                You can't really do much with it. Like computer chips, it is all about on/off states.
