                Purchasing furniture is not the same as purchasing furniture on IKEA.
                What you buy on IKEA comes in peaces that you have to assemble.
                You put effort on it, you remember how you did it.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                Take it to the next level, you build your own furniture with planks, with tools, you shape it the
                way you want, the color you want. And then, eventually you have to move to a new apartment.
                You are not leaving that behind, you did it, you love it.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                During almost my entire life, I have been doing code. From personal projects to work related projects.
                But I want to leave my signature in what I do, I want to remember what did. This could be even one of
                my obbsessions. Maybe no one will see what did, but I will.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                For this reason almost all my projects are documented in a way it will be easy to understand, and sometimes,
                dependeing from the project, understood even by non tech people.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                For ilustration, here is one perfect example of a project I did during a weekend, that makes me remember it with love.
                And also, makes me able to explain how I did it to my friends or anyone that could have interest on it.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                I present you to my <a href="https://github.com/nuriofernandez/keys-in-door-experiment" target="_blank">keys-in-door-experiment</a> project,
                a system I build to stop forgetting about my keys on my apartment door's outside. You can read more about in the repository. But basically
                it's a RTSP connection to a security camera checking if the keys are in specific cordinates with a simple and non machine-learning code.

                Sometimes, I even add animated gifs to my README files to explain things even better, such as

                a library I build for driving a car inside the game <b>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</b>.
